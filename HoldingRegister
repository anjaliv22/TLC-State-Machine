-- allows the traffic signal to hold the pedestrian request signal in the NS or EW direction until the state machine is ready to clear it.
-- The pedestrain request signal is cleared when the pedestrians have crossed or can no longer cross because the light is now amber.
-- Another case of when the pedestrian request is pressed is that it jumps states so it shortens the waiting time for pedestrians
entity holding_register is port (
clk : in std_logic;
reset : in std_logic;
